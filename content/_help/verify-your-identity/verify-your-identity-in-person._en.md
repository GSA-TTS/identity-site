Login.gov offers in-person identity verification with the United States Postal Service (USPS). In-person identity verification is only available for some partner agencies.

## How do I verify my identity in person?

You can choose to verify your ID in person instead of taking photos of your ID online, or switch to in-person identity verification if you are having trouble taking photos.

We need to [verify your personal information](/help/verify-your-identity/issues-verifying-my-personal-information/) and the information on your ID before you go to the Post Office. Then we [verify your phone number](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/) and send you a one-time code to verify that the phone number belongs to you.

Once you verify your information online, we will email you a barcode and a deadline to go to the Post Office.

When you go to the Post Office, bring:

- The same ID that you used to enter your information on Login.gov.
- The barcode that Login.gov emailed to you. You can print the email or show the email from your mobile device.

## I received an unsuccessful email result after going to the Post Office

You can try to verify your identity again, either online or in person. Make sure that you are using a valid ID type that is not expired.

## I did not receive an email from Login.gov after going to the Post Office

You’ll get an email within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office. We’ll tell you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful.

Check your email for a message from [no-reply@login.gov](mailto:no-reply@login.gov). If you have not received an email after 24 hours, contact [Login.gov support](https://login.gov/contact/).

## I am having a problem with my barcode

Your barcode will not work at the Post Office if your deadline to visit a Post Office has passed, 30 days after you verify your information online. You’ll have to restart the process to verify your identity from the beginning to get a new barcode.
