Login.gov offers in-person identity verification with the United States Postal Service (USPS). You will need to complete some identity verification steps online, then bring your ID to a [participating Post Office](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/find-a-participating-post-office/). In-person identity verification is only available for some partner agencies.

## How to verify in person

You can choose to verify your ID in person instead of taking photos of your ID online, or switch to in-person identity verification if you are having trouble taking photos.

We need to [verify your personal information](/help/verify-your-identity/issues-verifying-my-personal-information/) and the information on your ID before you go to the Post Office. Then we [verify your phone number](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/) and send you a one-time code to verify that the phone number belongs to you.

Once you verify your information online, we will email you a barcode and a deadline to go to the Post Office.

1. Wait in line at the Post Office.

2. Tell the retail associate: “I received an email telling me to get this barcode scanned at this Post Office” or “I’m here to verify my information/identity.” If the retail associate still does not know how to proceed, you can request a supervisor to help you.

3. The retail associate will scan your barcode and review your ID. After the retail associate has reviewed your documents, you’re done at the Post Office. The retail associate will not receive your results.

4. You’ll get an email from [Login.gov](/) within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office telling you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful. Check your email for a message from [no-reply@login.gov](mailto:no-reply@login.gov).

## Troubleshooting

### I got an unsuccessful email result after going to the Post Office

You can try to verify your identity again, either online or in person. Make sure that you are using a valid ID type that is not expired.

### I didn't get an email from Login.gov after going to the Post Office

You’ll get an email within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office. We’ll tell you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful.

Check your email for a message from [no-reply@login.gov](mailto:no-reply@login.gov). If you have not received an email after 24 hours, contact [Login.gov support](https://login.gov/contact/).

Your barcode will not work at the Post Office if your deadline to visit a Post Office has passed. Your barcode expires 7 days after you verify your information online. You’ll have to restart the process from the beginning to get a new barcode.
