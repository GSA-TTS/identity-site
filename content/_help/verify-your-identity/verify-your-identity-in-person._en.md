Login.gov offers in-person identity verification with the United States Postal Service (USPS). In-person identity verification is only available for some partner agencies.

## How do I verify my identity in person?

You can choose to verify your ID in person instead of taking photos of your ID online, or switch to in-person identity verification if you are having trouble taking photos.

We need to [verify your personal information](/help/verify-your-identity/issues-verifying-my-personal-information/) and the information on your ID before you go to the Post Office. Then we [verify your phone number](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/) and send you a one-time code to verify that the phone number belongs to you.

Once you verify your information online, we will email you a barcode and a deadline to go to the Post Office.

When you go to the Post Office, bring:

- The same ID that you used to enter your information on Login.gov.
- The barcode that Login.gov emailed to you. You can print the email or show the email from your mobile device.

## What ID can I use to verify my identity in person?

Login.gov accepts these ID types:

* Driver’s license from all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and other U.S. territories (Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico).
* Non-driver’s license state-issued ID card. This is an identity document issued by the state, the District of Columbia (DC), or U.S. territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.

We do not accept:

* U.S. passports
* military IDs
* expired IDs or extension documents
* paper or temporary IDs
* non-U.S. IDs

Your ID must not be expired. If you do not have one of these ID types, you cannot use Login.gov for in-person identity verification. Please contact the agency you are trying to access to find out what you can do instead.

## Which Post Office can I visit to verify my identity?

When you start the process on Login.gov, you can select a participating Post Office near you. You can also [search for a Post Office near you](#) in Login.gov’s Help Center.

Once you have received a barcode online, you can go to any Post Office where in-person identity verification is available. In-person identity verification is available in all 50 states and the following U.S. Territories: U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.

## Who do I speak to at the Post Office?

Wait in line at the Post Office. The retail associate will scan your barcode and review your ID.

Tell the retail associate: “I received an email telling me to get this barcode scanned at this Post Office” or “I’m here to verify my information/identity”. If the retail associate still does not know how to proceed, you can request a supervisor to help you.

After the retail associate has reviewed your documents, you’re done at the Post Office. The retail associate will not receive your results.

## What happens after I go to the Post Office?

You’ll get an email from [Login.gov](https://secure.login.gov/) within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office telling you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful. Check your email for a message from [no-reply@login.gov](mailto:no-reply@login.gov).

## I received an unsuccessful email result after going to the Post Office

You can try to verify your identity again, either online or in person. Make sure that you are using a valid ID type that is not expired.

## I did not receive an email from Login.gov after going to the Post Office

You’ll get an email within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office. We’ll tell you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful.

Check your email for a message from [no-reply@login.gov](mailto:no-reply@login.gov). If you have not received an email after 24 hours, contact [Login.gov support](https://login.gov/contact/).

## I am having a problem with my barcode

Your barcode will not work at the Post Office if your deadline to visit a Post Office has passed, 30 days after you verify your information online. You’ll have to restart the process to verify your identity from the beginning to get a new barcode.
