Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

If you are under 18 years of age, you may not be able to verify your identity for a Login.gov account. If you have trouble verifying your identity, please contact the partner agency to find out what you can
do.

## Requirements for identity verification

1. Your [drivers license or state ID card.](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-identification-documents/) You can upload a photo of your ID by phone or by computer.
1. Social Security number
1. Your phone number 
    * If we can't verify your phone number, you can [verify by mail](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-address-by-mail/) instead. This takes 5 to 10 days.
1. Taking a photo of yourself
Some services need you to take a photo of yourself with a phone to verify your identity online. If you don't have a phone with a camera, you can [verify your identity in person.](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/)
