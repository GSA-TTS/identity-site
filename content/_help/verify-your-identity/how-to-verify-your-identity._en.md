Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

If you are under 18 years of age, you may not be able to verify your identity for a Login.gov account. If you have trouble verifying your identity, please contact the partner agency to find out what you can do.

## Requirements for identity verification

{: .number-list}
1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo of your ID by phone or by computer. [Don’t have a state issued ID?](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-state-issued-identification/) 
1. Social Security number
1. Your phone number 
    * If we can't verify your phone number, you can [verify by mail](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-address-by-mail/) instead. This takes 5 to 10 days.

If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.
