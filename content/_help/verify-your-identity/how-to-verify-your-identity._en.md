Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

You will need to verify your identity and secure your account.

## Requirements for identity verification

{: .number-list}
1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo of your ID by phone or by computer. [Don’t have a state issued ID?](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-state-issued-identification/) 
1. Social Security number
1. Your phone number 
    * If we can't verify your phone number, you can verify by mail instead which takes approximately 3-5 days. 

If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.

## Our privacy and security standards
Login.gov is a secure, government website that adheres to the highest standards in data protection. Most of the data you submit is not stored. Learn how we verify your identity and the [privacy and security measures](/policy/) we take to keep your information safe.
