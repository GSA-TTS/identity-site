1. Take your photo in a well-lit place, while avoiding glare.

1. Make sure your entire face is visible, from your chin to the top of your head. Only wear accessories, like glasses, that you also wear in your ID photo. Remove any other items covering your face.

1. Line up your face with the guidelines. Keep your expression neutral and remain still.

1. Follow the instructions to take a photo. The camera tool may automatically take a photo, or you may need to tap a button to take the photo.

1. Tap the checkmark or follow the instructions to accept the photo.

If you submit your photos and get an error message that “We couldn't match your selfie to your ID”, check that your entire face is visible and clear in the photo. Avoid bright light, glare, or shadows.

If you continue to get errors, or if you look very different from your ID photo, you may be able to [verify your identity in person](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/) at a United States Post Office near you.
