Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. After [you create your Login.gov account](/create-an-account/) or sign in, you may need to verify your identity to access services at some agencies.

## What do I need to verify my identity?

You will need a driver’s license or state ID, a Social Security number, and a U.S. phone number or mailing address to verify your identity with Login.gov.

If you don’t have all of these requirements, contact the agency you are trying to access to find out what you can do instead.

## What ID can I use?

### Login.gov accepts these ID types:


{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.accept_id_list size='md' icon_color='success' icon_shape='check_circle'%}

### We do not accept:


{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.reject_id_list size='md' icon_color='error' icon_shape='cancel' %}
