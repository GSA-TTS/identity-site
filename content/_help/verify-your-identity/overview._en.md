Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. You will need to [create your Login.gov account](/create-an-account/) and verify your identity to access services at some government agencies.

## What you’ll need to verify your identity

You’ll take a photo of your [accepted driver’s license or state ID card](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-identification-documents/) and enter your personal information to verify your identity online.

You may need to take a [photo of yourself](/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-take-photos-to-verify-your-identity/#how-to-take-photos-of-yourself) with a phone to verify your identity online. This is to check that you are the person on your ID. If you don’t have a phone with a camera, you can [verify your identity in person](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/).
