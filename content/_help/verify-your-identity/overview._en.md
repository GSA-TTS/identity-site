Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you — and not someone pretending to be you. After [you create your Login.gov account](/create-an-account/) or sign in, you may need to verify your identity to access services at some agencies.

## What do I need to verify my identity?

To verify your identity with Login.gov, you will need a:
{% include components/large-icon-check-list.html large_icon=verify_document items=page.verify_identity_list image_alt_text='verify-document' image='/assets/img/verify-document.svg' %}

If you don’t have all of these requirements, contact the agency you are trying to access to find out what you can do instead.

## How do I verify my identity?

1. Take [photos of your ID online](/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-take-photos-to-verify-your-identity/). Use an [accepted ID type](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-id-type/). In some cases, you’ll be asked to [take a selfie](/help/verify-your-identity/issues-taking-a-photo-of-myself/) to confirm that you are the owner of your ID. If you have trouble taking photos, you may also be able to [verify your identity in person](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/) at a United States Post Office near you.

1. Enter your Social Security number and we will [verify your personal information](/help/verify-your-identity/issues-verifying-my-personal-information/) against public and proprietary records.

1. [Verify your phone number](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/) and send a one-time code to your phone. If that doesn’t work, we may be able to [verify your address by mail](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-address-by-mail/) instead.

1. Re-enter your password to store your verified information in your account, and connect your information to the partner agency you are trying to access.

## How does Login.gov use my information?
