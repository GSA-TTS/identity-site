do_list: 
  - Do use a high resolution camera like a smartphone or tablet camera. Your computer webcam may not take clear photos.
  - Do use a solid, dark background.
  - Do take your photos in a well-lit area with indirect light.
  - Do check that ID barcodes are not damaged or dirty.
  - Do try to hold your phone still while taking the photos. It may help to prop your arms on the table to steady yourself.

## If you don’t have access to a phone with a camera, you can upload a file or use a scanner
* Follow the same [tips for taking photos with a phone](#phone-tips).
* Save each file as a JPG or PNG. You cannot use a PDF file. Look at the name of your file and it should have an abbreviation after the title (ex: JohnDoeID_Front.jpg).
* Make sure your images are high-resolution (around 2025 x 1275 pixels is ideal).
* Images should be in color.
