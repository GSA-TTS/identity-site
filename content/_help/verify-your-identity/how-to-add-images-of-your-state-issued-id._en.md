  - Do use a high resolution camera like a smartphone or tablet camera. Your computer webcam may not take clear photos.
  - Do use a solid, dark background
  - Do take your photos in a well-lit area with indirect light
  - Do check that ID barcodes are not damaged or dirty
  - Do try to hold your phone still while taking the photos. It may help to prop your arms on the table to steady yourself.
  
alert: <strong>If you do not have a valid drivers' license or state ID card, you cannot use Login.gov for identity verification.</strong> Please contact the partner agency’s help center to find out what you can do instead."

## If you don’t have access to a phone with a camera, you can upload a file or use a scanner
- Follow the same tips for taking photos with a phone
- Save each file as a JPG or PNG. You cannot use a PDF file. Look at the name of your file and it should have an abbreviation after the title (ex: JohnDoeID_Front.jpg)
- Make sure your images are high-resolution (around 2025 x 1275 pixels is ideal)
- Images should be in color
