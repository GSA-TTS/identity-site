To verify your identity, you will need to take photos of your ID online, or [bring your ID in person](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/) to a United States Post Office.

## I am having trouble taking photos of my ID

You need a phone or tablet with a camera to take photos of your ID using Login.gov’s camera tool, not a webcam.  If you are using a computer, we will text you a link to open Login.gov on your phone or tablet. You will switch back to your computer after you take photos.

    Place your ID on a solid, dark background.

## I don’t have a phone or tablet with a camera

If you don’t have a phone or tablet with a camera, you may be able to [verify your identity in person](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/) at a United States Post Office near you.

## The camera tool is not working

If Login.gov’s camera tool to take a photo of your ID is not working, check that you are using the latest version of your iOS or Android operating system, and that you are using the recommended web browser for your phone or tablet.

You may need to update your operating system or web browser, clear your cache or cookies, or give Login.gov permission to use the camera.

      <li>To give Login.gov permission to use the camera, allow access to the camera in Safari</li>

## I got an error that Login.gov could not verify my ID

If you submit your photos and get an error message that we could not verify your ID, check that you are using an accepted ID type.

<div class="usa-accordion usa-accordion--bordered margin-y-4">
  <h4 class="usa-accordion__heading">
    <button
      type="button"
      class="usa-accordion__button"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="id-types-accordion"
    >
      Accepted ID types
    </button>
  </h4>
  <div id="id-types-accordion" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
    <p><strong>Login.gov accepts these ID types:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Driver’s license from all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and other U.S. territories (Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico).</li>
      <li>Non-driver’s license state-issued ID card. This is an identity document issued by the state, the District of Columbia (DC), or U.S. territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not accept:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>U.S. passports</li>
      <li>military IDs</li>
      <li>expired IDs or extension documents</li>
      <li>paper or temporary IDs</li>
      <li>non-U.S. IDs</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Make sure that your name, address, and other information on your ID can be easily read. Avoid bright light, glare, or shadows that make it hard to read the ID.
