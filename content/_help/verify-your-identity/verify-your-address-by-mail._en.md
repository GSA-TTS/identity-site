In some cases, you can verify your address by mail instead of [verifying your phone number.](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/) You will get a letter in the mail with a verification code to finish verifying your identity.

We send the letter to an address that we have verified and associated with you. If you need to change this address, you will need to start over and verify your identity again with the new address.

Letters are sent the next business day via USPS First-Class Mail. The verification code will expire 30 days after the date when you submit your request.

## Request a new verification code if:

 * You don't get your letter within 5 to 10 days
 * Your verification code has expired

To request a new verification code:
{: .number-list}
1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov/).  
2. Select “Send me another letter” when asked to enter your code.
