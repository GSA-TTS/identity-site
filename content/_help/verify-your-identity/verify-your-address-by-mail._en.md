In some cases, you can verify your address by mail instead of [verifying your phone number](/help/verify-your-identity/phone-number/). You will get a letter in the mail with a verification code to verify that the address belongs to you.

## How do I verify my address by mail?

{: .number-list}

1. Confirm that you want to request a letter to the address you verified earlier.

1. Re-enter your password to save the information you verified so far and send your letter.

1. When you see a screen that your letter is on the way, you can sign out of Login.gov for now and wait for your letter to arrive.

1. Letters are sent the next business day via USPS First-Class Mail. It takes about 5-10 days to get your letter in the mail. The verification code will expire 30 days after the date when you submit your request.

1. Sign back in and enter the verification code when your letter arrives.

## I cannot receive mail to the address listed

We send the letter to an address that we have verified and matched to your other information. If you need to change this address, you will need to verify your personal information again with the new address.

## I didn’t get a letter in the mail

If you didn't get a letter after 5-10 days, or if your verification code expired, you can request a new verification code.

To request a new verification code:

{: .number-list}

1. Go to <https://secure.login.gov> and sign in.

1. Select “Send me another letter” when asked to enter your code.

Contact the agency you are trying to access if you need to access their services before your letter arrives.

If you started verifying your identity more than 30 days ago, you will need to start over and verify your identity again before you can request a new letter.
