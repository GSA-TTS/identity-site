## I received an email from Login.gov, but I did not attempt to verify my identity at a Post Office

Sign into your Login.gov account and [change your password immediately](https://login.gov/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/). If you’d like, you can also [delete your account](https://login.gov/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/).

## I received an unsuccessful email result after going to the Post Office

  * Try to verify your identity again, either online or in person. Your state-issued ID or driver’s license must not be expired. We do not currently accept any other forms of identification.
  * Contact the partner agency’s help center for support.

## I didn’t receive any emails from Login.gov after going to the Post Office

  * You'll get an email within 24 hours of visiting a Post Office. We'll tell you if your identity verification was successful or unsuccessful. Check your email for a message from no-reply@login.gov. 
  * [Contact Login.gov customer support](https://login.gov/contact/) if you have not received an email after 24 hours.

## I’m having a problem with my barcode

Your barcode will not work at the Post Office if:
  * You reset your password before visiting a Post Office. We strongly encourage you to always save your password and Personal Key in a secure location.
  * Your deadline to visit a Post Office has passed. We cancel barcodes after 30 days to protect your personal data.

You’ll have to restart the process to verify your identity from the beginning. If you verify in person, you will receive a new barcode and deadline to visit a Post Office.
