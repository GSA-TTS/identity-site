At this time, only the following state-issued identification is accepted: 

* Driver’s license from all 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)
* A non-driver’s license state-issued ID card

  * This is an identity document issued by the state, the District of Columbia (DC), or US territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.

**Are paper or temporary IDs accepted?**\
No, you cannot use a paper or temporary ID. 

**What if my ID is too worn or damaged?**\
You cannot pass identity verification if your ID is too worn or damaged. 

**What if my current address is different from the address on my ID?**\
You can change your address on the ‘verify’ step after you enter your Social Security number. The address will need to match an address on record for you. 

If you do not have state-issued identification or cannot complete this step, please contact the partner agency’s help center to find out what you can do.
