We check your phone number and other personal information with public and proprietary records and send you a one-time code to verify that the phone number belongs to you.

## What phone number can I use?

The phone number that you use to verify must be based in the United States. We are most likely to successfully verify your phone number if you enter your primary number or the number that you use most often.

### Login.gov accepts:

{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.can_verify_list size='md' icon_color='success' icon_shape='check_circle'%}

### We do not accept:

{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.cannot_verify_list size='md' icon_color='error' icon_shape='cancel' class='margin-top-2'%}
{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.maybe_verify_list size='md' icon_color='warning' icon_shape='warning' class='warning-list-margin'%}

## Troubleshooting

### Login.gov couldn't match me to my number

* Check that:
    * Your phone number is entered correctly.
    * You are using an accepted type of phone number.
* Turn off call forwarding while you are verifying your identity.
* Try another number that is associated with your name.

Some agencies do not allow you to [verify your address by mail](/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-address-by-mail/) instead of verifying your phone number. For these agencies, you must verify your phone number to successfully verify your identity with Login.gov. If you don’t have another phone number to try, contact the agency you are trying to access to find out what you can do instead.
