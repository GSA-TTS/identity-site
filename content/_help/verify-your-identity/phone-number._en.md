We match your phone number with records to verify your identity. The phone number that you use to verify your identity must be based in the United States.

We are most likely to successfully verify your identity if you enter your primary number (the number that you use most often).

## You can verify your identity with your:

{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.can_verify_list size='md' icon_color='success' icon_shape='check_circle'%}

You can use a prepaid cell phone to verify your identity. However, some prepaid phone numbers contain risk factors that might cause you to fail identity verification.

## You cannot verify your identity with:

{% include components/icon-list.html items=page.cannot_verify_list size='md' icon_color='error' icon_shape='cancel' %}

## If you cannot complete this step

If your phone number is correct, turn off call forwarding while you are verifying your identity (you can turn call forwarding back on when you are done). Try another number that is associated with your name.

In some cases, you may be able to select “Verify your address by mail instead.” You will have to wait 5 to 10 days to receive a letter in the mail and then follow the instructions to enter the verification code.

If you do not have the option to verify by mail, you must verify by phone to successfully verify your identity.
