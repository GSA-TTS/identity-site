We match your phone number with records to verify your identity. The phone number that you use to verify your identity must be based in the United States.

We are most likely to successfully verify your identity if you enter your primary number (the number that you use most often).

## You can verify your identity with your:
- Home number
- Work number
- Cell or mobile number
- Landline number

You can use a prepaid cell phone to verify your identity. However, some prepaid phone numbers contain risk factors that might cause you to fail identity verification.

## You cannot verify your identity with:
- International numbers and numbers in some U.S. territories
- Google voice or similar VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) numbers
- Premium rate (toll) numbers

## If you cannot complete this step
In some cases, you may be able to select “Verify your address by mail instead.” You will have to wait 5 to 10 days to receive a letter in the mail and then follow the instructions to enter the verification code.

If you do not have the option to verify by mail, you must verify by phone to successfully verify your identity.
