You are not required to upload a picture of yourself, or take a selfie, for identity verification. However, a [clear photo of your state-issued ID](/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-add-images-of-your-state-issued-id/) is required for identity verification. If you’ve taken a photo that meets the requirements, try the steps below if you’re still getting an error while uploading your state-issued identification.

You can make 10 attempts to upload your document. Once you’ve made 10 attempts, the system will lock you out for six hours as a security precaution.

Please contact the agency you are trying to access if the steps below do not work and you are unable to complete the identity verification process.
