1. Use strong, unique passwords
	- Create longer passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
	- Avoid using personal details like birth dates or names.
	- Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.

2. Add more secure [authentication methods](/help/create-account/authentication-methods/)
	- Use authentication methods like [face or touch unlock](/help/create-account/authentication-methods/face-or-touch-unlock/) when possible, which are resistant to phishing attacks: people pretending to be someone you trust to gain access to your account.

3. Monitor your account regularly
	- [Sign in](https://secure.login.gov/) frequently to check for unfamiliar changes such as new email addresses or MFA methods added to your account.
	- Check your Login.gov account History for unusual logins.
	- Review your linked agencies and services to ensure nothing unexpected is connected.
	- Keep your email address and authentication methods up to date in case you lose access to them.

4. Beware of [suspicious emails or messages](/help/fraud-concerns/verify-messages/)
	- Never share your password or security codes with anyone.
	- Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.
	- Bookmark legitimate pages, such as the [Login.gov sign-in page](https://secure.login.gov/), to avoid the risk of clicking on fake links.

5. Secure your devices
	- Install software updates for your devices regularly.
	- Avoid using public Wi-Fi, which can be monitored or compromised, when signing into your account.
