Scammers are constantly developing new methods to trick people into sharing their personal information or making fraudulent payments. Staying informed about these tactics is your best defense. Below are some of the most common techniques, as well as methods to protect yourself.

## Fake emails and texts

Scammers send emails or text messages that look official, often using government logos and language. This is called phishing. Phishing attacks may:

- Urge you to click on a link to “verify your account”
- Claim there is an urgent issue with your benefits or tax return
- Ask for personal information such as Social Security numbers or bank details

### How to protect yourself

- Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown senders.
- Verify the message by contacting the agency directly using official contact information.
- Report fraudulent messages to the agency the scammer is trying to represent

## Impersonation phone calls

Fraudsters may call pretending to be government representatives. They often:
- Threaten arrest, license suspension, or loss of benefits
- Demand immediate payment via gift cards, cryptocurrency, or wire transfers

### How to protect yourself

- Government agencies will never ask for payment over the phone.
- Hang up and call the official number listed on the Login.gov or agency website.

## Fake websites and online portals

Some scams use fraudulent websites designed to look like official government pages. These sites may:

- Ask you to log in with personal details
- Charge fees for services that are free on official sites

### How to protect yourself

- Always check that the website URL ends in .gov.
- Avoid using search engines for sign in links—type the official URL directly and double-check the spelling.

## Social media scams

Scammers create fake social media profiles claiming to be government officials. They may:
- Offer grants or financial assistance in exchange for upfront fees
- Ask for personal or banking details through direct messages

### How to protect yourself

- Note that government agencies do not send unsolicited messages about benefits.
- Report suspicious profiles on social media to the social media platform.
