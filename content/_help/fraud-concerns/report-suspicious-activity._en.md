If you suspect that your [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) account has been compromised or you are a victim of fraud we recommend that you:

- [Change your password](/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/)
- Contact Login.gov using the contact form on our [Contact us page](/contact/) or call our 24/7 phone number, (844) 875-6446.

Login.gov cannot investigate claims of fraud involving other agencies or services. However, if you believe your personal information was used fraudulently, or that someone created an account in your name, you should report it to the appropriate authorities:
