Scammers often create emails, texts, or phone calls that look like they are from a government agency. If you receive a message and aren’t sure whether it’s legitimate, follow these steps:

{: .number-list}

1. Check the sender’s details
- Email: Official agency emails typically end with .gov (e.g., name@agency.gov).
- Phone calls: Caller ID can be faked, so don’t rely on the number alone.
- Text messages: Most agencies do not request sensitive information by text.

2. Look for signs of fraudulent messaging
- Urgent language like “Act now” or “Immediate action required”
- Requests for personal information, such as Social Security numbers or banking details
- Threats of arrest, loss of benefits, or legal action
- Payment requests via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency

3. Do not click links or download attachments
- Scammers often include malicious links or files in emails and texts.
- Avoid clicking links or downloading attachments until you confirm the message is real.

4. Verify using official sources
- Call us directly: Use the official number listed on our [Contact Page](https://login.gov/contact/).
- Check your account: Sign in through the official [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) website, rather than by clicking links in the suspicious message.

5. Report the fraud
   - To report identity theft:
     - Website: [IdentityTheft.gov](https://www.identitytheft.gov/){:class="usa-link--external"}, run by the FTC
     - Phone: 1-877-438-4338
