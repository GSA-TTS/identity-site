## Concerned About Fraud or Unauthorized Activity?

If you suspect that your Login.gov account has been compromised—or you’ve noticed suspicious activity—we’re here to help you take immediate steps to protect your identity and account security.

### Check for Suspicious Activity

You can review recent sign-ins and devices associated with your Login.gov account:

1. **Sign in** at [Login.gov](https://secure.login.gov/)

2. Navigate to your **account page**.

3. Select **"History"** to view your recently used devices and sign-ins.

If you see any device or sign-in that you don’t recognize, we strongly recommend you:

   * **Immediately** change your password, and
   * **Review your authentication methods** to ensure they are up to date and secure.
