There are a few reasons why you may be receiving Login.gov security codes to your phone that you didn’t request.

For example, someone may have accidentally entered your phone number instead of their own when creating their account or, someone else who has access to your phone may be using it to sign in to their account (like a spouse, parent, or child).

If someone is trying to sign in to your account, they can't sign in without your authentication method. This means that they need the security code you received on your phone or access to one of your other enabled authentication methods.

To make sure your account is safe, we recommend signing in to your account at secure.login.gov and doing the following:

* Change your password
* Make sure your authentication methods are correct, up to date, and secure
* If you have backup codes set up as an authentication method, regenerate and save new backup codes

If you continue to receive these codes or suspect there is a security problem, please [contact us](https://login.gov/contact/).
