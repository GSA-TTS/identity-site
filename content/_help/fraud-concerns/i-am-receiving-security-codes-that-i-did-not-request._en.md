If you are receiving one-time codes to your phone that you didn’t request from Login.gov:

- Someone may have accidentally entered your phone number instead of their own when creating their account.
- Someone else who has access to your phone may be using it to sign into their account (like a spouse, parent, or child).

If someone is trying to sign in to your account, they can't sign in without your [authentication method](/help/create-account/authentication-methods/), such as one-time codes via text or call. This means that they need the one-time code you received on your phone, or access to one of your other enabled authentication methods. Do not share these codes with anyone.

To make sure your account is safe, [sign into Login.gov](https://secure.login.gov) and then do the following:

{: .number-list}

1. [Change your password.](/help/manage-your-account/change-your-password/)
2. Make sure your authentication methods are correct, up to date, and secure.
3. If you have [backup codes](/help/create-account/authentication-methods/backup-codes/) set up as an authentication method, regenerate and save new backup codes.

If you continue to receive these one-time codes or suspect a security issue, please [contact us](/contact/).
