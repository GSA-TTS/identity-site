Backup codes are an accessible option for users who do not have access to a phone. However, backup codes are the least secure option for two-factor authentication. Backup codes must be printed or written down which makes them more vulnerable to theft and phishing.

## How to set up backup codes

If you select this less secure option, Login.gov will generate a set of ten codes. After you sign in with your username and password, you will be prompted for a code. Each code may be used only once.

When the tenth code has been used you will be prompted to download a new list. Treat your recovery codes with the same level of care as you would your password.
