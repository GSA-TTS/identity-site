Login.gov is for secure sign in only. Your Login.gov account does not affect or have any information about your retirement annuity or benefits.

Please do not send Login.gov sensitive data about yourself or identifying numbers.

Login.gov can only answer questions about the sign-in process to Retirement Services Online and creating a Login.gov account.

In 2023, OPM transitioned to Login.gov for users to sign in to Retirement Services Online. Refer to OPM’s [Login.gov linking guide](https://www.opm.gov/support/retirement/faq/sol-login-linking-guide.pdf) for step-by-step instructions.

Please [contact OPM Retirement Services](https://www.opm.gov/support/retirement/contact/) directly for questions about:

* One-time passcodes to link your Login.gov account
* Benefits (health, survivor, disability, court-ordered, life insurance) 
* Changes of personal or mailing information
* Claim status
* Annuity verification
* Taxes


Important notes for accessing Retirement Services Online:

* Sign in directly on the [Retirement Services Online](https://www.servicesonline.opm.gov/) website. Do not sign in to Login.gov and then navigate to Retirement Services Online.
* When you log in for the first time (or if your account is locked due to inactivity), you will need to link your Retirement Services Online account with Login.gov.
* To link your accounts, you will use a one-time passcode from OPM. This passcode is different from the Login.gov one-time passcode (if you use that Login.gov 2-factor authentication method).
* New annuitants should have received a one-time passcode from OPM in the mail. Please try to use this code before requesting a new one, as the system will not allow two active codes at the same time. If you still need to request a passcode, scroll to the bottom of the Verify your Account page, click the “Request passcode" button, and follow the instructions.

Submit a help request on the [Contact OPM Retirement Services](https://www.opm.gov/support/retirement/contact/) page, or call 1-888-767-6738 (TTY: 711) Monday–Friday, 7:40 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. The busiest caller center time is 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. ET, and the call center is closed on federal holidays.
