You can use backup codes that are generated by Login.gov. This option is always available with no additional software.

## My Backup codes don’t work

Make sure you’re using a backup code that you haven’t used yet. When you use all ten backup codes, we will provide you a new list of backup codes.

## I don’t have any Backup codes left

The system automatically generated new backup codes for you the last time you logged in to your account. If you forgot to print or copy your backup codes, you will need to delete and recreate your Login.gov account. You must have previously set up at least one other authentication method to be able to regenerate backup codes.

You will need to wait 24 hours after you delete your account to recreate a new account with the same email address.

Please visit <https://login.gov/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/> for instructions on how to delete your Login.gov account and <https://login.gov/help/get-started/create-your-account/> to recreate your Login.gov account.
