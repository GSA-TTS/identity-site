Text messages/SMS or phone calls are convenient but are extremely vulnerable to theft, hackers, and other attacks.

After you receive the code, type it into the “One-time code” field. Each time you sign in to Login.gov you’ll have the option of getting a new one-time code by phone call or by text. You will receive a new one-time code each time you sign in to your Login.gov account.

## I’m not receiving a text or phone call

Didn’t receive your one-time code?
* Check that your device is turned on
* Turn airplane mode off

Remember you need a mobile device to receive a one-time code by text message. If you have a landline, select to receive the one-time code by phone call instead.

You can resend a one-time code by selecting using the “resend code” button.
* If you have a landline phone, choose to receive your one-time code by phone call instead of a text message. You’ll receive a voicemail if you can’t answer the call.
* If you have a mobile phone, make sure airplane mode is off.
* Your code may not arrive immediately. Wait up to 10 minutes, or try the “Resend code” button to send your code again.
* Make sure you’re not using a phone number with an extension, as Login.gov cannot send one-time codes to extensions.

{% capture one_time_code_alert_content %}
Only the newest one-time code you receive will work. If you request and receive multiple messages at the same time, you may need to try more than one code until one works.
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html type="info" class="margin-bottom-4" content=one_time_code_alert_content %}

**If you have opted out of receiving text messages in the last 30 days**

You can opt-in your phone number 30 days after the opt-out date to receive a security code again. We recommend you choose another authentication method to access your account.
