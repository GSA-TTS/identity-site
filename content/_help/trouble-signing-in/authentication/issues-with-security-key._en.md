## My security key was lost or stolen

If youâ€™ve lost your security key, use your second authentication method to access your account. If you do not have a secondary authentication method, you need to delete your account and create a new account.

## My security key is not FIDO compliant

If a message displays that your security key does not appear to be FIDO compliant, please make sure your device is listed as [FIDO-certified](https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/){:class="usa-link--external"}.

If you believe the error is ours, please [contact us](/contact/).

## Browser is not supported

Currently, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox support the security key functionality. It will not work on Internet Explorer (Edge) or other browsers.

If you see an error message when trying to set up your security key, try again using a recent version of either Chrome, Safari,  or Firefox.

## Trying to register a security key twice

You can only register the same security key once to your account. Add a different security key.
