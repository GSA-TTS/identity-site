## My PIV/CAC card isn’t working

Some possible reasons your PIV/CAC isn’t working when authenticating include:

* Login.gov is missing your certificate
* You need to renew your certificate (every 3 years)
* You have to replace your PIV/CAC (every 5 years)

[Contact Login.gov support](/contact/) for additional help.

If you have recently received a new PIV/CAC card, you will need to remove the old PIV/CAC and add the new PIV/CAC card.
* You must have one other authentication method set up to disable an old PIV/CAC card and enable a new PIV/CAC card.
* If you have an issue with your PIN or certificate you will need to contact your IT Department. Login.gov doesn’t control this information.
* Your PIV/CAC card can only be associated with one Login.gov account.

If you want to make changes to your current PIV/CAC card as an authentication method, please follow these steps:
