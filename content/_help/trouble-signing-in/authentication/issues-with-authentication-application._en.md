## My Authentication application isn’t working

The time may not be correctly synced between your device and your Authentication application. Make sure your device’s time is correct by using a page like time.gov.

* If you use Google Authenticator, you may need to sync the time manually. Follow Google’s instructions to sync your time.

## I have a new phone and my Authentication application is not working

If you are using an authentication app, and are experiencing issues obtaining your security code, contact the developer of the authentication application to resolve your issue.

## Why am I being charged for my Authentication application codes?

You should not be charged for using authenticator applications like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. If you're being charged, it's likely you've installed a scam application or an application offering premium features you didn't purchase.

Login.gov cannot help resolve this issue. Please contact the developer of your authentication application.
