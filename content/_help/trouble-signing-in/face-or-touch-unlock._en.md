Face or touch unlock is an authentication method that lets you sign in to your account. When you set up face or touch unlock, your device will record your face or fingerprint as a credential. Then, you'll be able to scan your face or fingerprint credential each time you sign in to prove your identity. Please note that [depending on your device](#trouble-setting-up), you may get asked to [scan a QR code](#qr-code-info).


Face or touch unlock is phishing-resistant and secure, because it uses your face scan or fingerprint and is stored to your device or the cloud. We do not store recordings of your face or fingerprint.

## Commonly asked questions for face or touch unlock

### I’m having trouble setting up or signing in with face or touch unlock. {#trouble-setting-up}

Face or touch unlock works best on the following device and browser combinations:

* Devices
    * Laptop or desktops running Windows 10, macOS 13, Chrome OS 109, or newer
    * Mobile devices running iOS 16, Android 9, or newer
    * Your device must have screen unlock enabled

* Browsers
    * Chrome 109 or newer
    * Safari 16 or newer
    * Edge 109 or newer 

**Important**: You will need to enable cloud sync on your device if you want to use face or touch unlock to sign in to Login.gov across devices. Your device may show you other authentication features, such as signing in by scanning a QR code.

We strongly recommend adding a second authentication method in case you replace or lose your device. If you lose access to your only authentication method, you will need to delete your account and create a new one.

### I’m getting a message about a QR code, security key, or passkey. I don’t know what this is and/or I don’t remember setting this up. {#qr-code-info}
Depending on your device and browser combination, you may get a message about a QR code, security key, or passkey: 

* If you get a message to scan a QR code, use the camera on your mobile device to scan the QR code on your screen. We advise you to scan the QR code with the device you originally used to set up face or touch unlock.
* If you get a message about a security key, but do not have access to one, choose an option that uses a different device.
* If you see messages mentioning passkeys, they are referring to face or touch unlock. When you set up face or touch unlock, you create a passkey on your device.

If you are still having trouble, you may need to [delete your account](/en/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/). [Contact our help desk](/en/contact/) if you need assistance.

### I lost my phone or got a new phone, and now I can’t use face or touch unlock to sign in.

Face or touch unlock will only work on the original device you set it up with unless you set up face or touch unlock on a newer device and browser that supports [passkeys](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/){:target="_blank" class="usa-link--external"}, and has bluetooth and/or cloud-sync between your accounts enabled.

If face or touch unlock is tied to your device and you don’t have access to it any longer, you may need to [delete your account](/en/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/) and create a new one. Please [contact us](/en/contact/) if you need assistance.

To prevent having to delete your account in the future, we strongly recommend setting up more than one authentication method. That way, you have a back-up authentication method to use for signing in in case you lose one.
