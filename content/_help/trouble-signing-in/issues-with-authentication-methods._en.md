## Forgot or lost your personal key

Depending on the authentication methods you’ve set up, you may still be able to access your Login.gov account. After you’re able to sign in, make sure you’ve set up more than one authentication method to avoid losing access to your account.

{% capture delete_account_alert_content %}
If you cannot sign in with your only authentication method, you will have to delete your account and create a new account. For security purposes, Login.gov cannot unlock your account for you or sign in on your behalf.
{% endcapture %}
{% include alert.html type="warning" class="margin-bottom-4" content=delete_account_alert_content %}
