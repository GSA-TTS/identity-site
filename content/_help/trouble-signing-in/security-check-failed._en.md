Login.gov uses [reCAPTCHA](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha?hl=en){:class="usa-link--external"} to ensure your account is being accessed by you — not someone pretending to be you.

## How do I access my account?

To increase your chances of passing [reCAPTCHA](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha?hl=en){:class="usa-link--external"} try the following:

- Use the same device and browser you created your Login.gov account with.
- Try [signing in with your government employee ID](https://secure.login.gov/login/piv_cac) if you are a government employee.
- Turn off any VPN, ad blockers, and clear your cache.
- Try a different time of day, a different browser or update your browser to the latest version.
- We recommend installing and running antivirus software on your device in case malware is interfering with Login.gov’s security checks.
- If none of the above help, [contact Login.gov support](/contact/).
