A personal key is a 16-character code that encrypts your personal information with your account. Your personal key is the only way to access your information if you lose or forget your password.

Keep in mind:

- You’ll need to verify your identity again if you reset your password without your personal key. 
- Personal keys can only be used one time. If you’ve used a personal key to reset your password before, you have a new personal key. 
- You can find your current personal key on your account page.

You get your personal key when you verify your identity. Save and keep your personal key in a safe place. You can copy, download, or print it.
