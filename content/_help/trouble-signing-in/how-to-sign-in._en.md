## Forgot or lost your personal key

A personal key is a 16-character code that encrypts your personal information with your account. Your personal key is the only way to access your information if you lose or forget your password.

Keep in mind:

- You’ll need to verify your identity again if you reset your password without your personal key.
- Personal keys can only be used one time. If you’ve used a personal key to reset your password before, you have a new personal key.
- You can find your current personal key on your account page.

You get your personal key when you verify your identity. Save and keep your personal key in a safe place. You can copy, download, or print it.

## If you lost your phone

If you are able to regain access to your phone’s original phone number, do so first and then request a one-time code. You should still receive the code, even if you’re using a new device and SIM card.

If you selected phone call or text message as your authentication method, your phone must be present to get the security code to sign in. We encourage you to add multiple authentication methods — this way, you’ll be able to access your account even if your device is stolen or your online accounts are hacked.


### To log into Login.gov when your phone is not available:

{: .number-list}

1. If you have added more than one authentication method, sign in with your email address and password.
1. When it asks you for the security code sent to your phone, select “Choose another security option”.
1. Select any of the other security options you have previously configured, then follow the steps to sign in.
