Login.gov is the public’s one account and password for the government. Login.gov is a shared service and trusted by government agencies. With one Login.gov account you can access websites and applications from participating government partners.

You need an email address, password and a multi-factor [authentication method](https://login.gov/help/get-started/authentication-methods/) (MFA) to create an account.

- Choose an email address that you’ll always be able to access (ex: a personal e-mail, rather than work unless required to do so)
- Passwords must be 12 characters
- An authentication method is an added layer of protection to your account. Review the authentication methods available and select the most accessible and secure choice for your account.

Login.gov requires all users to use  Multi-factor authentication when creating an account and signing in.

If you do not have a phone that you can use for this, you can choose to use one of the other authentication methods (security options) available. You can use an authentication application, backup codes, or a security key. Government employees can also use their PIV or CAC cards.
