A security key is a physical device that you can connect to your computer or mobile device to add an extra layer of protection to your Login.gov account. It is not the same as a [personal key](/help/manage-your-account/personal-key/).

Using a security key is more secure than relying on your phone because it has built-in protections against hacking and phishing attacks. Login.gov requires security keys that meet the [FIDO (Fast Identity Online) standards](https://fidoalliance.org/).

You can add multiple security keys to your account to secure your account.

Login.gov does not provide users with a security key, so you will need to obtain one on your own to use this secure option.

## How to set up a security key

1. Assign a nickname to your security key so that you can easily identify it with your Login.gov account later.
2. Insert your security key into your device.
3. Follow your browser’s instructions to activate your security key. You won’t need to enter a code when using your security key.
