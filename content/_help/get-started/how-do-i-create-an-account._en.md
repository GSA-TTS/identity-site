Follow these steps to create your Login.gov account.

{: .number-list}

1. Enter your email address at <https://secure.login.gov/sign_up/enter_email> to begin.

   Choose an email address that you’ll always be able to access. Once your account is created, you can add an additional email address, such as a work email or alternate personal address, to access your account.
2. Click the **“Submit”** button.
3. Check your email for a message from Login.gov.
4. Click the **“Confirm your email address”** button in the message. This will take you back to the Login.gov website.
5. Create your Login.gov password.

   * To help prevent identity theft, consider strengthening your password by using:
     * Unique phrases that only you recognize
     * Multiple words with spaces to get to 12 characters
     * Numbers and special characters


   * Your password must have 12 or more characters and avoid combinations such as:
     * Common phrases or repeated characters, like abc or 111
     * Parts of your email address or personal dates, like your birthday
     * The same password, or parts of it, that you use for other accounts, such as your bank account or email
6. Set up a second layer of security.

   As an added layer of protection, Login.gov requires you set up an authentication method to keep your account secure. This is referred to as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

   We encourage you to have more than one authentication method on your account. You can choose from several authentication options.

   **More secure:**

   * Security key
   * Face or touch unlock
   * Authentication application
   * PIV or CAC card for federal government employees or military

   **Less secure:**

   * Text message
   * Phone call
   * Backup codes

   [Learn more about each authentication option](/help/get-started/authentication-methods/) to choose the one that is right for you.
7. Success! Once you have authenticated, you have created your Login.gov account.

   You will be taken to your Login.gov account page or the government agency you are trying to access. You can add additional authentication methods, email addresses or update your information on the Login.gov account page.
