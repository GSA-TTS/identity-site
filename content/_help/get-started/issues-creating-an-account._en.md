Here are solutions to the issues you may run into when creating a Login.gov account:

## I’m not receiving a confirmation email

**If you did not receive your confirmation email:**
- Check your spam folder for an email from no-reply@login.gov or an email from the @mail.login.gov domain, as our emails are sometimes incorrectly put there.
- Add “no-reply@login.gov” to your contact list. Once this is done, request another email.
- Use a different email address to create your account

**If you use email forwarding:**

Occasionally, email forwarding does not work for all emails.
- Sign in to the original email you're forwarding from and check for the Login.gov email there.
- Reach out to your email provider about the issue if you don’t have access to the original email account.

## I’m getting an email that says I already have an account

If you received a notice that there is already a Login.gov account associated with your email address, but you don’t remember creating it, [reset your password](/help/trouble-signing-in/forgot-your-password/) through Login.gov

## Login.gov is not accepting my email address or my phone number for authentication

If your email address or phone number isn't accepted, it is possible that the information you entered is incorrect, you’re using Voice Over IP (VOIP), or there's a temporary issue with the system. It's also possible that you might be locked out and need to delete and recreate your account.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential issues and solutions:

**Incorrect Information:**
- Double-check for typos. Ensure your email address and phone number are entered correctly, including any special characters or formatting.
- Make sure your email address is a functional one you can access.
- Ensure your phone number is valid and that you can receive text messages or phone calls on it. Do not use web-based (VOIP) phone services or premium rate (toll) phone numbers.
- If you're receiving a phone/SMS verification code, double-check that you're entering it correctly.

**System Issues:**
- Login.gov may be experiencing temporary technical difficulties, so try again later.
- Check if there are any known outages or maintenance on the <https://status.login.gov/> website.

## I’m having trouble creating a password

Your password must be **12 characters** or longer. Don’t use common phrases or repeated characters, like abc or 111. A strong password should include a combination of numbers, letters, and special symbols (!, @, %).

**Avoid reusing passwords** from your other accounts, such as your banks, email and social media. If your other passwords get hacked, your Login.gov account may be compromised. Don’t include words from your email address.
