If you received an email informing you that the deadline to verify your identity passed, try [verifying your identity online again](https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/). 

We automatically cancel requests after 30 days in order to protect applicants’ personal data. When you restart the process to verify your identity in person, you will receive a new deadline.
