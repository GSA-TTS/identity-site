 **There might be different reasons why you need to delete an account:**

* You realize you have multiple accounts using different email addresses and you want to have one account
* You are locked out of your account and have lost access to your authentication methods
* You no longer need a Login.gov account

**If you delete your account:**

* We'll delete your email address, password, and phone number
* You won't be able to sign into partner agencies that require a Login.gov account
* You won't lose your information saved with partner agencies, but you will need to create a new Login.gov account

**If you do have access to your authentication methods, follow these steps to delete your account:**
