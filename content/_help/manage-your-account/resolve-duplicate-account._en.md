Some government agencies only allow you to have one verified Login.gov account. If you have more than one Login.gov account using the same verified information, you’ll need to delete the duplicate accounts.

{: .number-list}
1. **Choose an account to keep**

    Keep the account you use the most. For example, the one tied to the most services. That way, you won’t have to reconnect services.

    To see which agencies an account is connected to, sign in and click on “Your connected accounts” in the left sidebar.

2. **Delete the duplicate accounts**

    [To delete an account](/help/manage-your-account/delete-your-account/):
    * Sign into the account you are going to delete.
    * Go to “Your account” and choose “Delete your account” in the left sidebar.

    If you [forgot your password](/help/trouble-signing-in/forgot-your-password/), try resetting it from the sign in page.

    If you can’t authenticate into the duplicate account:
    * Click “Choose another method” after signing in.
    * Scroll to the bottom of the page and select “Delete your account”.

3. **Sign in with your remaining account**

    Go back to the agency’s website and sign in using the one Login.gov account you kept.


## What if I don’t recognize or can’t delete an account?
