A deactivated Login.gov account can happen for a few reasons including password resets or security violations.

* If you verified your identity and reset your password without your personal key, your account might be deactivated temporarily, requiring you to verify your identity again.
* Login.gov may revoke access if it detects fraud or other violations of our [Rules of Use](/policy/rules-of-use/).
