If you have problems signing in to a Login.gov partner website after changing your email address, then it is possible the partner linked your account to a different email address. You may want to relink your account to access your information or profile on the partner website. 

Try the following:

1. Sign in using the previous email address you used to register with the partner agency. 
2. Contact the partner agency and ask them to link your account to the new email address.
