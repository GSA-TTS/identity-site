Login.gov allows you to control which email address is shared with each partner agency. You can select an existing email or add a new email from the following pages:

- On the “You are now signing in for the first time” page when signing in to any new partner agency for the first time
- On the “Connect your verified information to...” page after you verify your identity
- From the “Your connected accounts” page

You can add multiple email addresses to your Login.gov account and you can delete any email address associated with your Login.gov account. Go to the [Change the email address associated with your account](/help/manage-your-account/change-your-email-address/) page to learn more.
