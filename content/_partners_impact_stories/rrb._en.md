    ## Railroad Retirement Board's (RRB) story
body: >-
    The RRB supports the nation’s railroad workers and their families with comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness benefits. The RRB’s mission is to “pay benefits to the right people, in the right amounts, in a timely manner, while safeguarding customers’ funds.”

    ### The challenge

    Railroad workers in the United States use the Railroad Retirement Board’s online portal, myRRB, to access their benefits and other important information. In addition to being time-consuming for both beneficiaries and staff, the original user application lacked crucial security measures. Because RRB regularly deals with high-risk financial transactions and the personal information of beneficiaries, it is imperative that users and the agency have confidence in the identity verification process. A simple, easy-to-use interface was important as well.


    RRB wanted to increase security while not leaving their users behind. The agency identified three priority areas:

    * Increase their application’s security to protect users.

    * Uphold the highest standards of privacy protections and security.

    * Provide an efficient high-quality user experience.


    Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic upended travel nationwide, affecting railroad employees and leading to layoffs and furloughs. At the onset of the pandemic, RRB’s unemployment application demands significantly increased.

    ### The solution

    RRB met increased demand through their integration with Login.gov, helping users verify their identity more quickly and reducing benefits processing time by weeks, and in some cases months. RRB’s implementation of Login.gov for identity verification led to a reduction in calls and paperwork volume during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic (summer to fall 2020).


    A solution that started as a small element of an overall digital strategy is now available to the nation’s railroad workers. Login.gov looks forward to expanding this model to meet the needs of even more users for everyday transactions and during critical times.
