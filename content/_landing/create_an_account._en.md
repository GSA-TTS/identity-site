  intro: "When you’re ready to create your secure Login.gov account, you’ll need
    to provide a few pieces of information:"
  step1: >-
    ## 1. Email address

    * We recommend a personal email address that you’ll always be able to access rather than a work email address.

    * If you use an email address that is already associated with a Login.gov account, we’ll email instructions on how you can reset your password and regain access to your account.
  step2: >-
    ## 2. Secure password

    * Passwords must be at least 12 characters and should not include commonly used words or phrases.
  step3: >
    ## 3. One or more [authentication
    methods](/help/get-started/authentication-methods/)
    such as:


    * **More secure**
      * Face or touch unlock
      * Security key
      * Federal government employee or military identification (PIV/CAC)
    * **Less secure**
      * Authentication application
      * Text/voice message
      * Backup codes
  info: Depending on the security needs of the agency, you may need to prove your
    identity using a social security number, address, and/or U.S. based
    state-issued identification.
