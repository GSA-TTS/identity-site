    ## One account and password


    Login.gov is a secure sign in service used by the public to sign in to participating government agencies. Participating agencies will ask you to create a Login.gov account to securely access your information on their website or application.


    You can use the same username and password to access any agency that partners with Login.gov. This streamlines your process and eliminates the need to remember multiple usernames and passwords.


    ### Login.gov is used to secure your account when you apply for


    * Federal jobs (USAJOBS  - Office of Personnel Management)

    * Global Entry (Trusted Traveler Programs - Department of Homeland Security)
    
    * And more…

    ## Secure and private access for the public


    Login.gov uses [the highest standards of security](/policy/) to keep your information safe including identity verification and [two-factor authentication](/help/get-started/authentication-methods/).


    Login.gov is provided by [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/tts).

    ## How does it work?


    Participating agencies use Login.gov to help protect their users. When you try to sign in to a participating agency, you’ll be prompted to sign in or create an account with Login.gov before you can access your profile with that agency.

    ### All participating agencies use Login.gov for secure sign in.


    You provide two pieces of information to securely sign in and protect your information. 


    * Password 

    * Authentication method (such as a one-time code sent to your phone or an authentication app) 


    Using both a password and another method makes it difficult for others to access your information.

    ### Some agencies require you to verify who you are. 


    Login.gov verifies your identity for the agency. By submitting personal identifiable information (PII), such as your photo ID, you can verify that you are you and not someone pretending to be you. We only confirm that you are you and do not make any determination on eligibility for agency services.
