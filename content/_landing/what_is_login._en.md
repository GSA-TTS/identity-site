    ## One account and password


    Login.gov is a safe way to sign in to many U.S. government websites using just one account. It helps protect your information by asking you to take extra steps to make sure it’s really you when you log in.


    ### Login.gov is used to secure your account when you access:


    * Federal jobs (USAJOBS  - Office of Personnel Management)

    * Global Entry (Trusted Traveler Programs - Department of Homeland Security)

    * And more…

    ## Secure and private access for the public


    Login.gov uses [the highest standards of security](/policy/) to keep your information safe including identity verification and [two-factor authentication](/help/get-started/authentication-methods/).


    Login.gov is provided by [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://tts.gsa.gov/).

    ## How does it work?


    Participating agencies use Login.gov to help protect their users. When you try to sign in to a participating agency, you’ll be prompted to sign in or create an account with Login.gov before you can access your profile with that agency.

    ### How to sign in with your Login.gov account.


    You provide two pieces of information to securely sign in and protect your information. 


    * Password 

    * Authentication method (such as a one-time code sent to your phone or an authentication app) 


    Using both a password and another method makes it difficult for others to access your information.

    ### Some agencies require you to provide additional documents to verify who you are.


    To access some government websites, you will be asked to electronically  submit additional documents , so Login.gov  can verify your identity. For example, you may be asked to take a picture of your photo ID or provide a picture of yourself. If you prefer, or are unable to electronically submit these pictures, you will have the option to provide your photo ID in person at a participating U.S. Postal Service location. We only use the documents and photos to confirm your identity. Login.gov does not make any determination on eligibility for agency services.
