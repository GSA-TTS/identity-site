        title: Is Login.gov a federal agency?
        content: >-
            Login.gov is not a stand alone federal agency. We are a program of the General Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. federal government. The program is run by the Technology Transformation Services, a group that leads the digital transformation of the federal government by helping agencies build, buy, and share technology that allows them to provide more accessible, efficient, and effective products and services for the American people.

        title: Does Login.gov partner with state and local governments?
        content: >-
            Yes, Login.gov partners with state and local governments. State and local governments need simple and secure solutions to help the public access federally funded services and resources. With this partnership, those agencies can leverage Login.gov to create a seamless and secure sign in experience for the public to access these resources.

        title: How do we partner with Login.gov?
        content: >-
            <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/16DIoo--rTU2xbNW1MShkBg3ak9e" class="external-link">Contact an account manager to get started.</a> We’ll work with you to understand and capture your needs and requirements at a high level. Together, we’ll decide whether Login.gov makes sense for your particular business and use cases. If we decide to move forward, the next step is to sign an Interagency Agreement (IAA). This signals a mutual commitment which allows us to commit further resources to technical discovery and integration and migration planning.

        title: What is an Interagency Agreement (IAA)?
        content: >-
            An Interagency Agreement (IAA) is a type of contract. Login.gov is a cost-recoverable federal service, which means we must, by law, charge other agencies for our work. Our partnership and financial engagement will be governed by the IAA.

        title: What is the timeline for a new IAA?

        title: Does Login.gov provide authorization?
        content: >-
            Login.gov does not provide authorization. At this time, Login.gov supports authentication and identity proofing capabilities. We encourage agencies to take the lead on determining the best strategy for their role management and authorization. Our industry partners can help develop or provide existing solutions that can address your authorization needs.

        title: Does Login.gov meet the NIST 800-63 standards for Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL)?
        content: >-
            For our Login.gov basic authentication accounts (IAL1), we rely on the user having access to an email address, password, and a secure multi-factor authentication method (AAL2 or higher) such as a phone, authentication app or PIV/CAC where they can receive a secure code to use to sign in to their account.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For identity proofing, in addition to meeting the above requirements for IAL1/AAL2, we ask users to upload a photograph of their state-issued ID and share their address, phone number and other personal information which is then verified against authoritative sources. Login.gov’s proofing process is based on the IAL2 specifications but does not fully conform to the requirements—specifically biometrics and liveness check.

        title: What is identity proofing?
        content: >-
            “Identity proofing is the process by which a [credentialing service provider] collects, validates, and verifies information about a person.” (NIST) This is the process Login.gov uses to verify that a user is who they say they are. While many agencies can validate an individual’s identity through an in-person proofing experience, we developed an online application that allows individuals to have their identities verified from their smartphone or computer.

        title: What is the proofing rate?
        content: >-
            The proofing rates will vary by population and we work with the partner to find a solution for users who are not able to proof online. The goal is to provide a high level of assurance. Since launch, we have seen 65%-70% of users who attempt to upload an ID will proof their identity. This includes transactions classified as high risk and likely (or potentially) fraudulent.

        title: Can Login.gov authenticate or proof non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. immigrants (not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or traveling to the United States on an immigrant visa)?
        content: >-
            Check <a href="https://login.gov/help/manage-your-account/international-phone-support/" class="external-link">International phone number support</a> for a complete list that Login.gov supports for authenticating end-users. In addition to a phone number, at this time Login.gov requires users to proof with a state-issued ID card and social security number.

        id: b-9
        title: What forms of identification can Login.gov accept for identity proofing?
        content: >-
            At this time, only the following state-issued identification is accepted: 
    
            - Driver’s license from all 50 states and other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)

            - A non-driver’s license state-issued ID card
                – This is an identity document issued by the state/US territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.

            Users cannot verify their identity on Login.gov without a state-issued ID. We’re currently working to add more ways to verify identity. <a href="https://login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/how-to-verify-your-identity/" class="external-link">Learn more about the requirements for verifying identity</a>

        title: How is Login.gov going to improve proofing coverage?
        content: >-
            To improve proofing coverage, we plan on expanding our use of data sources to include government data sources not available through traditional commercial data sources as we are a trusted federal entity. Likewise, we plan on integrating with in-person proofing services offered by the USPS and other agencies.

        title: Can we have a sandbox?

        title: What do you support-SAML vs. OAuth vs. OpenID?
        content: >-
            SAML vs. OAuth vs. OpenID

            - We do not support the OpenID Connect “implicit flow” with `client_secret` because it is [not recommended by the OAuth group](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/implicit/){:class="external-link"} for security reasons. We do support OpenID Connect `private_key_jwt` and PKCE

        title: Do we need an approved IAA before we can launch our integration with Login.gov?
        content: >-
            In order to launch your integration with Login.gov, your agency must first complete an IAA. You can test your application during the IAA process.  Once testing is complete and the IAA has been executed, Login.gov will launch your integration within two weeks.
