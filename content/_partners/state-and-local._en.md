    Crises, like the COVID-19 global pandemic and ongoing natural disasters, make it more urgent than ever for the public to gain fast and easy access to their benefits and services. GSA’s Technology Transformation Services (TTS) realizes the burden this has put on state and local governments. Our team, with deep expertise in security, product, engineering, and user experience, is looking for state and local government partners looking to take advantage of all that Login.gov has to offer for their federally funded programs.

    “The SSA UXG team appreciates the willingness of the Login.gov team to listen to our goals, concerns, and questions, then work with us to identify a path forward that will benefit the customers (end users) of SSA and other federal agencies. The team’s flexibility and willingness to hear our suggestions is very much appreciated. We enjoy brainstorming together and sharing research findings as we try to help each other move forward.”

    ## Steps to partnership
partnership_steps_header1: >-
    Introductions and determine compatibility

    Estimate usage and test integrations
partnership_steps_body2: >-
    During onboarding, an account manager will work with your agency to estimate usage and provide a cost estimator. Once you’ve created your application and implemented an identity protocol, you can register it in the test environment dashboard and start testing. We advise at least two to three weeks for your team to test and integrate with Login.gov. <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.login.gov/testing/#how-to-get-started" class="external-link">Learn more about the sandbox environment</a>

    Establish an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA)
partnership_steps_body3: >-
    Login.gov is a cost-recoverable federal service, which means we must, by law, charge for our work. Our partnership and financial engagement will be governed by an Intergovernmental Cooperation Agreement (IGCA). An IGCA is a contract between a federal agency and a non-federal entity, like a state or local government. For Login.gov, these are the contracts we have with state and local governments that let them use Login.gov as partners/clients. An IGCA may take at least six to eight weeks to complete, which can occur in parallel with the technical integration of your application. <a href="#intergovernmental-cooperation-act-igca-process" class="caret">Learn more about the IGCA process below</a>

    Launch integration
partnership_steps_body4: >-
     Once testing is complete and the IGCA has been executed, Login.gov will launch your integration within two weeks.

    Tips for completing the IGCA process:

    * Determine your executive for IGCA sign-off

    * Have approved funding access based on the cost estimator

    * Ensure your technical team has capacity for integration or plan to hire a team


    The above suggestions may help keep your agency on track for creating the IGCA and receiving proper approvals within the anticipated six to eight week timeline, and launching your integration with Login.gov.
