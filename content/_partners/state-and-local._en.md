  Crises, like the COVID-19 global pandemic and ongoing natural disasters, make it more urgent than ever for the public to gain fast and easy access to their benefits and services. The General Services Administration’s (GSA) Technology Transformation Services (TTS) realizes the burden this has put on state and local governments. Our team, with deep expertise in security, product, engineering, and user experience, is seeking state, local, and territory government partners that want to take advantage of all that Login.gov has to offer.

The team’s flexibility and willingness to hear our suggestions is very much appreciated. We enjoy brainstorming together and sharing research findings as we try to help each other move forward.”

  ## Steps to partnership
partnership_steps_header1: >-
  Introductions and determine compatibility
partnership_steps_body1: >-
  <p style="display: inline">During the introduction call, an account manager will walk through Login.gov services and answer any questions that you have. This step will determine if Login.gov is a good fit for your agency. <a href="https://federalist-17bd62cc-77b7-4687-9c62-39b462ce6fd5.app.cloud.gov/preview/18f/identity-site/partners-redesign/partners/contact/">Contact our Partnerships Team to get started.</a></p>

  Estimate usage and test integrations
partnership_steps_body2: >-
  During onboarding, an account manager will work with your organization to estimate usage and provide a cost estimator. Once you’ve created your application and implemented an identity protocol, you can register it in the test environment dashboard and start testing. We advise at least two to three weeks for your team to test and integrate with Login.gov. <a href="https://developers.login.gov/testing/#how-to-get-started" class="external-link">Learn more about the sandbox environment</a>

  Establish an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA) agreement
partnership_steps_body3: >-
  Login.gov is a cost-recoverable federal service, which means we must, by law, charge for our work. Our partnership and financial engagement will be governed by an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA) agreement. An IGCA agreement is a contract between a federal agency and a non-federal entity, like a state or local government. For Login.gov, these are the contracts we have with state, local, and territory governments that let them use Login.gov as partners/clients. <a href="#intergovernmental-cooperation-act-igca-process" class="caret">Learn more about the IGCA process below</a>

  Launch integration
partnership_steps_body4: >-
  Once testing is complete and the IGCA agreement has been executed, Login.gov aims to launch your integration within two weeks.

  Tips for completing the IGCA agreement process:

  * Determine your executive for the IGCA agreement sign-off

  * Have approved funding access based on the cost estimator

  * Ensure your technical team has capacity for integration or plan to hire a team


  The above suggestions may help keep your agency on track for creating the IGCA agreement and receiving proper approvals.
