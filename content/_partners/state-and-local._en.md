  Although Login.gov was founded to provide digital identity solutions to federal agencies, we've since begun to serve a number of state and local partners. That's because state and local governments face similar challenges when offering digital services to their constituents. Login.gov makes it easy for your constituents to access your services while protecting against cybersecurity threats and fraudulent schemes. In fact, many of them will already have a Login.gov account from their interactions with the Federal Government that they can reuse, making it even easier to do so.
disclaimer: >-
  We support a variety of use cases - anywhere from enabling a state-wide enterprise type solution to supporting a single program. And as a Government program, we only serve Government agencies, meaning that we understand and focus on supporting your use cases. We’d love to work with you, regardless of whether your applications are associated with a federal program or funding source.


  Please reach out to our partnerships team at <partners@login.gov> as you have questions.

  ## Steps to partnership
partnership_steps_header1: >-
  Introductions and determine compatibility
partnership_steps_body1: >-
  During the introduction call, an account manager will walk through Login.gov services and answer any questions that you have. This step will determine if Login.gov is a good fit for your agency. [Contact our Partnerships Team to get started](/partners/business-inquiries/){:class="external-link"}.

  Estimate usage and test integrations
partnership_steps_body2: >-
  During onboarding, an account manager will work with your organization to estimate usage and provide a cost estimator. Once you’ve created your application and implemented an identity protocol, you can register it in the test environment dashboard and start testing. We advise at least two to three weeks for your team to test and integrate with Login.gov. [Learn more about the sandbox environment](https://developers.login.gov/testing/#how-to-get-started){:class="external-link"}.
partnership_steps_header3: >-
  Establish an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA) agreement
partnership_steps_body3: >-
  Login.gov is a cost-recoverable federal service, which means we must, by law, charge for our work. Our partnership and financial engagement will be governed by an Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (IGCA) agreement. An IGCA agreement is a contract between a federal agency and a non-federal entity, like a state or local government. For Login.gov, these are the contracts we have with state, local, and territory governments that let them use Login.gov as partners/clients. [Learn more about the IGCA process below](/partners/state-and-local/#intergovernmental-cooperation-act-igca-process).

  Launch integration
partnership_steps_body4: >-
  Once testing is complete and the IGCA agreement has been executed, Login.gov aims to launch your integration within two weeks. We recommend a grace period between deployment and implementation on your site.
igca_tips: >-
  Tips for completing the IGCA agreement process:

  * Determine your executive for the IGCA agreement sign-off

  * Have approved funding access based on the cost estimator

  * Ensure your technical team has capacity for integration or plan to hire a team


  The above suggestions may help keep your agency on track for creating the IGCA agreement and receiving proper approvals.
