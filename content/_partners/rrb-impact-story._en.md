    Impact story
quote: >-
    “Partnering with Login.gov allows our agency to scale on demand and offer helpdesk services at a significant savings compared to maintaining the architecture and staff ourselves. We immediately saw the benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Not to mention the added savings from outsourcing the continuous improvement process and keeping up with digital identity guidelines. We’ve been able to reallocate those resources to developing more online services for our claimants.”

    ## Railroad Retirement Board’s (RRB) story
body: >-
    The RRB supports the nation’s railroad workers and their families with comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness benefits. The RRB’s mission is to “pay benefits to the right people, in the right amounts, in a timely manner, while safeguarding customers’ funds.”

    ### The challenge

    The people who use RRB–retired railroad workers and their families–use the online portal to access their retirement benefits. The original user application process was time consuming for both RRB staff and beneficiaries. 


    Worst of all, it lacked crucial security measures. RRB regularly deals with high-risk financial transactions, so identity verification is crucial. User experience was important since site visitors, especially older ones, needed increased support. Better user experience would reduce support requests.


    One way we could improve the site is to move from single sign-on authentication to multi-factor authentication. 


    RRB wanted to increase security while not leaving their users behind. It had to 

    * increase their application’s security to protect users

    * uphold the highest standards of privacy protections and security

    * provide an efficient high-quality user experience

    ### The solution

    The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) has approximately 770 employees serving over 500,000 beneficiaries. The RRB’s unemployment application demands increased in April 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. With Login.gov, claimants can now verify their identity online and immediately access services supporting their benefits. They can do this without calling, mailing forms, or visiting the agency’s field offices. RRB users who verify their identity online are able to reduce the normal processing time for critical unemployment and sickness benefits.

    ### The impact

    Login.gov can easily integrate with most systems, and RRB had fewer system complexities. RRB could quickly adopt Login.gov technology. This implementation led to a 70% reduction in calls and paperwork volume (summer to fall 2020).


    With Login.gov, claimants can now verify their identity online and immediately access  benefits. They can do this without calling, mailing forms, or visiting offices.


    This last element was particularly vital because RRB’s unemployment application demands increased in April 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. RRB users who could verify their identity online cut weeks and even months off the normal processing time. 


    The identity verification includes a three-step process:

    1. Users upload a photo of their state-issued identification.

    2. Users enter their social security number (SSN) and verify their name, date of birth, and address.

    3. Users verify their phone number with two-factor authentication. 


    The identity verification success rate improved from 35% in October 2019 to over 70%. RRB succeeded  because RRB’s benefit coordinators and contact center worked with Login.gov to change the portal  based on real-time customer feedback. 


    Login.gov was able to update the process in as little as two weeks. Now the identity verification process is easier to navigate. A solution that started as a small element of an overall digital strategy now helps all RRB users. It is currently being scaled to include other government agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service (late 2021), and the Social Security Administration (mid-2021).

    ### Key shifts

    * In partnership with Login.gov, the RRB aimed to use the latest innovations in digital security to protect customer information and ensure the right individuals claim the right benefits data points.

    * RRB has 800 employees that serve over 500,000 beneficiaries

    * The average proofing resolutions time during the peak of online traffic in March, April, and May was 4 ½  hours, thanks to Login.gov. If we’d been using the PINpassword,it would have taken days due to needing to mail the password to beneficiaries. 

    * Login.gov crafted messages to tell users where they were caught up in the process
