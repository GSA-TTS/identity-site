  ## High level overview


  Netlify will serve as the primary graphical user interface for creating, placing, and structuring files related to program update entries. Netlify offers a built in visual editor for creating and making basic changes to the page content targeted for non engineers/designers. Some content specialists on login are already familiar with it and have used it in the past. Additionally, existing infrastructure, including Github, Cloud.gov, and Jekyll, will be utilized.


  Users will login to the Netlify interface through Github, which facilitates user authentication and management. Once logged in, users will be presented with an interface to create new “Program Update” entries. This interface will allow the user to structure text and upload photos for their entries.


  After an entry is saved, the files are committed to Github, where a new pull request is automatically created and the content is placed in review. Users will be able to review the outline of content formatting and placement via the visual editor to verify the look and feel of the main content, however they will need to take additional manual steps in Github to retrieve the link and then navigate to the page, to get a full preview of the final page on the staging server.  At this point another user, likely an engineer, will review the update. Once the pull request is approved, the changes can be merged, making them live on the website and publishing the program update entry.


  Netlify acts primarily as an interface for users to structure the materials for the program updates. Netlify promotes a concept called “content-driven development”, which is detailed in their documentation. Github will assist with user authentication and content review, while Jekyll will transform the files generated by Netlify into a static website.


  For an example of what the interface and text editor will look like, please see the following image.

  ## Components to be implemented


  Templates will need to be updated in both Netlify and Jekyll.


  1. Netlify: A user interface for adding “program update” entries will be implemented.

  2. Jekyll: Static site generator to convert Netlify markdown to structured HTML files with CSS styling. Additional templates and code will be added to format the entries provided by Netlify. The two main templates to be added to Jekyll include: an index of program updates and individual pages for each program update.


  **\

  Current estimated Level of Effort for Implementation is 2 - 4 Sprints.**
