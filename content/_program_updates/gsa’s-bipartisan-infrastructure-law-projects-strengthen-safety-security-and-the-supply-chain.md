The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is celebrating the three-year anniversary of the passage of the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684), the largest infrastructure investment in U.S. history. The landmark legislation included $3.4 billion for GSA to undertake 26 major modernization and construction projects along the northern and southern borders. These investments will support commerce and trade, enhance safety and security, create good-paying jobs in local communities, all while boosting the efficiency and sustainability of these facilities. These investments will support an estimated 6,000 jobs per year across the U.S. during the course of the program, plus $3.2 billion in labor income and add $4.5 billion in Gross Domestic Product.

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is celebrating the three-year anniversary of the passage of the [Bipartisan Infrastructure Law](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684), the largest infrastructure investment in U.S. history. The landmark legislation included $3.4 billion for GSA to undertake 26 major modernization and construction projects along the northern and southern borders. These investments will support commerce and trade, enhance safety and security, create good-paying jobs in local communities, all while boosting the efficiency and sustainability of these facilities. These investments will support an estimated 6,000 jobs per year across the U.S. during the course of the program, plus $3.2 billion in labor income and add $4.5 billion in Gross Domestic Product.

“This is what the Biden-Harris Investing in America agenda is all about: a government-wide approach to boosting the economy, supporting national security, creating jobs, and building a more sustainable future and healthier communities for all Americans,” said GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan. “Using funding from the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law gets us closer to all of these goals and we’re proud to see this work continuing all across the country.”

In celebration of the anniversary, here are four projects that illustrate the impact GSA is making through these historic investments: 

## **Building a new commercial port in Arizona**

In Douglas, Arizona, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is enabling construction of a new commercial port which will be built approximately five miles west of the existing Raul Hector Castro Land Port of Entry, where inbound and outbound trucks currently have to maneuver within the same undersized commercial vehicle inspection compound, hindering traffic and safety. By relocating commercial operations from the existing Castro port to the new port, the project will increase the number of commercial vehicle inspection lanes from one to four, and the number of commercial vehicle inspection docks from 12 to 36 while also allowing for the processing of oversized mining equipment too large to cross at the Castro port. The existing Castro port will also be modernized and expanded.

“The new Douglas Land Port of Entry will significantly increase our ability to inspect commercial vehicles and process goods more efficiently, all while supporting economic growth in the region,” CBP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner Troy A. Miller said recently. “This project represents a critical investment in both the security of our nation and the prosperity of our border communities. By leveraging advanced technologies and sustainable design, we are also building a smarter, more resilient port of entry for the future.”

## **Expanding a critical trade and transportation gateway in Alaska**

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is enabling the renovation of the Alcan Land Port of Entry,  the only year-round, full service, 24-hour port of entry serving vehicles and commercial truck traffic between Yukon Territory, Canada, and interior Alaska.

Constructed in 1971, Alcan is the most isolated land port of entry between the US and Canada, processing commercial truck traffic, in addition to buses and privately-owned vehicles. The expansion and modernization project will enhance the port’s operational efficiency and capabilities, providing new, modern and energy efficient facilities to house port operations. This project will strengthen the supply chain, create good-paying jobs, enhance safety and security, and serve as a model of sustainability.

## **Strengthening border security and small businesses in Washington State**

In Blaine, Washington, GSA is expanding the Pacific Highway Land Port of Entry in ways that demonstrate the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to sustainability and small businesses. GSA recently awarded a $33 million contract to a Pacific Northwest Native-owned small business for the design and construction of the new port that will modernize the facility, altering its current traffic configuration to better meet the needs of the traveling public.

GSA plans to add four primary vehicle inspection lanes and one outbound inspection lane to the port, and to further support the[ NEXUS program](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/nexus). Additionally, the port will have enhanced secondary inspection capabilities, including six enlarged bays for vehicle inspections. All inspection areas will include extended overhead canopies, new pavement and upgraded lighting. By using low-embodied carbon construction concrete and steel for the new traffic lanes and canopies, GSA will boost domestic clean manufacturing industries while reducing emissions by an estimated 190 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

## **Facilitating trade and travel in Vermont**

In Vermont, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is allowing GSA to modernize the Highgate Springs Land Port of Entry, one of the three busiest ports in New England. The capital project will include a new 117,000 square foot facility that is better equipped to handle the port’s growing traffic volume in anticipation of Canadian Auto-Route 35 being completed in 2025.  The new highway will connect to U.S. Interstate 89 at Highgate Springs. The new land port of entry will improve public and officer safety, as well as expedite crossing times for the traveling public and businesses.

These investments demonstrate how President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is helping to grow  the American economy from the bottom up and the middle-out – from rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure, to creating a manufacturing and innovation boom to building a clean-energy economy that will combat climate change and make our communities more resilient.
