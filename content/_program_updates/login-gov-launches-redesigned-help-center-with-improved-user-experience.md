We’ve relaunched the Login.gov Help Center with a new design focused on making it easier for users to get the support they need. The upgraded Help Center features streamlined navigation, clearer article titles, improved readability, and updated content based on real questions from users. Built with accessibility and user research at the core, the redesign creates a more intuitive experience across devices.


This upgrade is an important milestone in improving support pathways and customer satisfaction with Login.gov. Since the Help Center is often the first stop for users seeking help and a key resource, we’ve ensured redirects are in place to minimize disruption. And this is only a starting point: we’ll continue expanding articles and features based on ongoing monitoring and feedback.
