We made a usability update to our recently launched identity verification with facial matching workflow. Last week, we changed the workflow to separate the document authentication step from the facial-matching step into two separate screens. Previously, both steps were presented on a single screen. Our research indicated that presenting both steps on a single screen confused some users. This change will mitigate that confusion and create a more mobile-friendly experience for users.Â
