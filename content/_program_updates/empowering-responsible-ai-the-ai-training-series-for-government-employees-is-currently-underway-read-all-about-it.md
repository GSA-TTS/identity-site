One of GSA’s strategic priorities is to deliver the best in digital government services, which includes staying on the leading edge of advancements in technology. As artificial intelligence technology becomes more widely available and becomes a key part of many products and services, it is crucial for governments to understand how to effectively use AI technologies while mitigating any risks they may pose. Training is an important part of [ensuring government employees can use AI safely and responsibly](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/), which is why GSA has partnered with the Office of Management and Budget to offer the [2024 AI Training Series](https://coe.gsa.gov/communities/AITraining.html). 

The 2024 AI Training Series began this month and runs through the end of October. We’ve seen demand grow a lot: this year, we have 41% more people registered than last year, bringing us to over 12,000 registrants, with an average 94% satisfaction rating to-date. [Registration is open](https://coe.gsa.gov/communities/AITraining.html) and free for all government employees with a .GOV or .MIL email address.

“We’re living in a unique moment, one where technology can be harnessed to improve people’s lives in new ways we never imagined,” said GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan. “This innovative training series advances the Biden Harris Administration’s landmark efforts to ensure the responsible and effective government use of AI by empowering public servants with the tools and the training we need to meet this moment and deliver better results for the American people. That’s what these training sessions and our AI Community of Practice are all about.”

The training’s approach is grounded in key principles such as safety and privacy in accordance with the [AI Training Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ207/PLAW-117publ207.pdf), [AI E.O. 13960](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/08/2020-27065/promoting-the-use-of-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-in-the-federal-government), [AI E.O. 14110](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/11/01/2023-24283/safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence), and [OMB’s first government-wide AI policy, M-24-10](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf). Training partners include the Stanford Human-Centered AI, the George Washington University Law School, Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy, Wilson Center, GSA Office of Government-wide Policy, and OMB.

“Once again, she \[the professor] does a masterful job of breaking down the important acquisition points related to Al,” said an Acquisition Track attendee. “She’s lively, entertaining and even injects some humor, when possible… This type of high-level acquisition strategy related to Al should become mandatory training for all Contracting Officers.”
