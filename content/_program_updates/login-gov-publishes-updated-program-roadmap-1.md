Weâ€™re excited to share the latest update of our publicly-available [program roadmap](/partners/roadmap/). It covers some of our most significant accomplishments from the first half of FY25, including:

* **Expanding our anti-fraud capabilities** - We're accelerating the impact of Login.gov's multi-layered fraud prevention program by partnering with new best-in-class vendors and deepening collaboration with agency partners to share insights, signals, and strategies across government.
* **Improving efficiency through smarter identity verification** - In partnership with the U.S. Department of State, Login.gov will soon accept U.S. passports as identity evidence, marking a first for digital identity in government. This, along with using authoritative data sources, will reduce friction for users and lower costs for agencies while upholding strict privacy protections.

The roadmap also includes our areas of focus for the current fiscal year and beyond such as adding to our library of educational videos to create a more user-centric experience, reusing existing government proofing mechanisms (e.g., PIV/CAC), and collaborating with NIST to further the adoption of verifiable digital credentials like mobile drivers licenses.
