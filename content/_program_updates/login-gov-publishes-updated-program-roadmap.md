---
We’re excited to share the latest edition of our publicly available [program roadmap](https://www.login.gov/partners/roadmap/). It covers some of our most significant accomplishments from FY 24, including:

* O﻿ffering a new IAL2-compliant identity verification service
* I﻿ntroducing a new, affordable pricing model that helps agencies more easily scale their adoption of Login.gov services
* P﻿artnering with the U.S. Department of State to deliver more [precise and culturally relevant translations](https://digital.gov/2024/12/17/approaching-language-translations-to-provide-a-better-user-experience/), and offering Simplified Chinese as a new support language
* M﻿aking in-person proofing available to all partners and users via 18K+ participating USPS locations

The roadmap also includes our areas of focus for the current fiscal year and beyond. We’re continuing to invest in features that meaningfully impact the American public and our partners – such as support for passports as identity evidence, a richer self-service Partner Portal, and a variety of new anti-fraud investments.
