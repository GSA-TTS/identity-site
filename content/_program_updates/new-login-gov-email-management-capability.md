Login.gov recently launched a new feature that makes it easier for people to manage their accounts: users can now choose which email address they want to share with a partner agency. 

For example, if someone uses Login.gov to access multiple services, they may choose to use their personal email address to sign into one agency, while using their professional email to log into another. 

Users can update their email information at three key points:

1. When signing into a new partner agency for the first time
2. During the consent screen after verifying their identity
3. Anytime, on the "Your connected accounts" page in their Login.gov account
