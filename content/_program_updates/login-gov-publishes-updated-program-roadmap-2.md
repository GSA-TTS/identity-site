We’re excited to share the latest update of our publicly-available [program roadmap](https://login.gov/partners/roadmap/). [](https://www.login.gov/partners/roadmap/)It covers some of our most significant accomplishments from FY25 and the beginning of FY26, including:

* **More ways to proof** now that Login.gov accepts U.S. passport booklets, with plans to reuse existing government proofing mechanisms (e.g., PIV/CAC) for identity verification.


* **Significant advancements toward NIST 800-63 Revision 4 alignment**, ensuring Login.gov remains a trusted and standards-driven service


* **An improved help center** for a more seamless user experience

The roadmap also includes our areas of focus for the current fiscal year and beyond such as developing our collaboration with NCCoE and NIST to further the adoption of verifiable digital credentials like **mobile drivers licenses within the Login.gov platform in 2026**.
