Determining the right level of identity assurance is a key consideration when integrating your application with Login.gov. This helps balance usability, identity fraud mitigation, and compliance requirements. While GSA does not determine the appropriate assurance level for our partners, we offer several [service offerings](https://login.gov/partners/our-services/) to meet agencies’ needs. 

Recently, we launched [enhanced identity verification](https://www.login.gov/partners/program-updates/login-gov-now-offers-an-ial2-compliant-identity-verification-service/) compliant with **NIST’s Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) standard** – many Login.gov partners are now in the process of upgrading their Login.gov service. 

To assist partner agencies, we have developed guidance on [determining your assurance level](https://login.gov/partners/determining-your-assurance-level/) to help you make your decision.
