    ## Understanding our service levels
subsection: >-
    Login.gov provides two service levels for partners: self-asserted identity and authentication (IAL1/AAL2) and Identity proofing and authentication (IAL2/AAL2).
authentication_vs_authorization: >-
    #### Authorization vs. authentication


    Authentication answers the question "who are you?" or "are you someone that I (the system) know?", while authorization answers the question "what are you (the user) allowed to do?".


    Login.gov does not provide authorization. At this time, Login.gov supports authentication and identity proofing capabilities.

    #### Authentication (IAL1) and Identity Verification (IAL2)


    We offer two levels of identity assurance within our platform. Basic authentication accounts (IAL1) requires users to create a secure account using an email address, password and a two-factor authentication method for an added layer of security (such as an SMS/Text code, authentication app, physical security key, PIV/CAC card or backup code).   


    Login.gov’s online identity verification (IAL2) requires  users to verify who they are from the convenience of their own home or on-the-go from their smartphone. Verification gives your agency confidence to provide services and benefits to the right person. We support NIST’s Identity Assurance Level 2 for our identity verification.

    #### Multilingual user support


    Login.gov provides customer support through our contact center services in English, Spanish and French from 8am-8pm Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Most inquiries are received from the Login.gov contact form and answered by email within 2 business days. 


    For more complex issues, our  agents are available to answer telephone calls as well.  Any needed services outside these hours are addressed on a case by case basis depending on partner needs.


    We also provide information to partner agency help desks and support teams to help end-users who may contact the agency with questions.
