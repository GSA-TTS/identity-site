    ## Understanding our service levels
subsection: >-
    Login.gov provides two service levels for partners: self-asserted identity and authentication (IAL1/AAL2) and Identity proofing and authentication (IAL2/AAL2).
authentication_vs_authorization: >-
    #### Authorization vs. authentication


    Authentication answers the question "who are you?" or "are you someone that I (the system) know?", while authorization answers the question "what are you (the user) allowed to do?".


    Login.gov does not provide authorization. At this time, Login.gov supports authentication and identity proofing capabilities.
