    ## Understanding our service levels
subsection: >-
    Login.gov provides two service levels for partners: authentication and identity verification. Login.gov follows <a target="_blank" href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/" class="external-link">NIST 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines</a> for Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). Login.gov allows you to configure your IAL and AAL depending on the needs of your application.
self_identity_auth: >-
    #### Self-asserted identity and authentication (IAL1/AAL2)


    Basic authentication accounts (IAL1) requires users to create a secure account using an email address and a password. 


    Login.gov also requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an additional security measure, such as an SMS/Text code, authentication app, physical security key, PIV/CAC card or backup code, which corresponds to NISTâ€™s AAL2 or higher.   
verified_identity_auth: >-
    #### Verified identity and authentication (IAL2/AAL2)


    Login.gov uses the same multi-factor approach for both IAL1 and IAL2, which is considered to be AAL2 or higher. 


    The IAL2 standard requires identity proofing. Login.gov asks the user to provide the following PII: their state-issued identification card (ID), Social Security Number (SSN), current address, and optionally a phone number to confirm home address.

    #### Multilingual support for your end-users


    Login.gov provides customer support through our contact center services in English, Spanish and French from 8am-8pm Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Most inquiries are received from the Login.gov contact form and answered by email within 2 business days. 


    For more complex issues, our agents are available to answer telephone calls as well.  Any needed services outside these hours are addressed on a case by case basis depending on partner needs.


    We also provide information to partner agency help desks and support teams to help end-users who may contact the agency with questions.
technical_support: >-
    #### Technical support for your agency


    Login.gov provides technical support for successful deployment of your integration. Our integration engineers can answer technical questions about our product, provide guidance on best practices for implementation, and facilitate the launch of your integration to production in weeks, not months.


    We also have a dedicated Slack channel for questions in real time. Additionally, we provide all partners with our step-by-step developer documents at <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.login.gov/" class="external-link">developers.login.gov.</a>
