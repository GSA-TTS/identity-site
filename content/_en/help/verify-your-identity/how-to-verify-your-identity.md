Some government applications require identity verification. This additional layer of security requires you to prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you.

You will need to verify your identity and secure your account.

## Requirements for identity verification
1. Your State-Issued ID. You can upload a photo by phone or by computer. [Don’t have a state issued ID?](/help/verify-your-identity/accepted-state-issued-identification/)
1. A phone or computer with a camera to take a photo of yourself (not always required)
1. Social Security Number
1. A phone number on a phone plan that is in your name.
    * If you do not have a phone plan that is in your name, we can send you the verification code by mail which takes approximately 3-5 days.

If you are missing any of this information, please contact the government agency you are trying to access.
