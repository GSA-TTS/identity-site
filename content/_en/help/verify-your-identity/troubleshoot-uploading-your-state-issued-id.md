A clear photo of your state-issued ID is required for identity verification. If you’ve taken a photo that meets the requirements, try the steps below if you’re still getting an error while uploading your state-issued identification.

You can make 10 attempts to upload your document. Once you’ve made 10 attempts, the system will lock you out for six hours as a security precaution. 

Please contact the agency you are trying to access if the steps below do not work and you are unable to complete the identity verification process.
