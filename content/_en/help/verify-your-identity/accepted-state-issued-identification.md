At this time, only the following state-issued identification is accepted: 

* Driver’s license from all 50 states and other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)
* A non-driver’s license state-issued ID card

  * This is an identity document issued by the state/US territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.

You cannot verify your identity on login.gov without a state-issued ID. We’re currently working to add more ways to verify your identity.

In the meantime, please contact the partner agency’s help center to find out what you can do.
