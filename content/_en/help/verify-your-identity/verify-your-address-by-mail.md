Identity verification is the process where you prove you are you - and not someone pretending to be you. One step in this process requires you to have a phone number with your name on the phone plan to automatically verify your address. 

If you do not have a phone number with your name on the phone plan, we will mail you a letter with a confirmation code. You will use this code to finish verifying your identity and setting up your account.

The letter is sent via the U.S. Postal Service three to seven business days after you request the code. The confirmation code will expire 30 days after the date when you submit your request.

If you do not receive your letter, or your confirmation code expires before you finish the identity verification process, you can request a new confirmation code.

## To request a new code

1. Go to [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov/).  
2. Select “Send me a new confirmation code” when asked to enter your code.
