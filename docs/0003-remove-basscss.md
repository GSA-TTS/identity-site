# 3. Remove BassCSS

Date: 2020-11-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In order to seamlessly incorporate the Login.gov and US Web Design System (USWDS), we need to remove BassCSS

## Decision

We will remove BassCSS FROM THE `identity-site` repo.

## Consequences

Transitioning from BassCSS to USWDS will allow designers and developers to use the Login.gov design system, which is an extension of USWDS. Login.gov and USWDS will become the foundation of layouts and styles on Login.gov. Removing BassCSS is a decision that has been made across the organization, therefore putting us in line with other teams.
