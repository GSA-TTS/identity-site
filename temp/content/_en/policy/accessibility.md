## Our commitment
Login.gov is committed to be inclusive and accessible for all of our users. Our focus is to continuously improve how people of all abilities are able to use Login.gov to easily access government applications and services.

## Standards
Login.gov aims to comply with the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

You should be able to do the following with Login.gov:

* Use a screen reader and read the content of the page by using the down arrow key.
* Be able to see and hear content including separating foreground from background.
* You can change font size easily using your browser. (Please refer to your browserâ€™s Help menu to learn how to re- size text.)

## Evaluation
Login.gov is regularly evaluated through a series of semi-automated evaluation tools and manual evaluation by expert reviewers. After each evaluation, we develop a plan to address any areas of improvement.

Our completed accessibility assessment reports can be found below:

## Known limitations
Below is a description of the types of accessibility limitations discovered in our evaluations.

### Images
Images and graphics make content more pleasant and easier to understand for many people, and in particular for those
with cognitive and learning disabilities. There are still some images that may create barriers for:

* People using screen readers: The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille
* People using speech input software: Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command
* People browsing speech-enabled websites: The text alternative can be read aloud
* Mobile web users: Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming
* Search engine optimization: images become indexable by search engines

### Keyboard navigation
With keyboard navigation, users can access and move between links, buttons, forms, and other controls using the Tab key and other keystrokes.

### Skip navigation
Allows users who use a keyboard to navigate a page the ability to activate the skip navigation link to skip over long lists and sublists of navigation and page header information.
