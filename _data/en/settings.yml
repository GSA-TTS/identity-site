    text: Join the millions of people who trust login.gov for safe, secure access to government agencies.
  intro: When you’re ready to create your secure login.gov account, you’ll need to provide a few pieces of information&#58;
  step_1: |-
    ## 1. Email address
      * We recommend a personal email address that you’ll always be able to access rather than a work email address.
      * If you already have an account with login.gov with that email address, we’ll send you an email to let you know how you can reset your password and access the account.
  step_2: |-
    ## 2. Secure password
      * Passwords must be at least 12 characters and should not include commonly used words or phrases.
  step_3: |-
    ## 3. One or more [authentication methods](__LOCALE_BASE_URL__/help/authentication-methods/which-authentication-method-should-i-use/) such as:
      * __More secure__
        * Security Key
        * Authentication application
        * Federal government employee or military identification (PIV/CAC)
      * __Less secure__
        * SMS/Text messages
        * Backup codes
  info: Depending on the security needs of the agency, you may need to prove your identity using a social security number, address, and/or U.S. based state-issued identification.
